# DAL-Tech-test-app-Pschool for DAL Technology app
Solution Documentation

-- Solution consists of 3 projects:
   1. For backend server app made with ASP.NET Web API
   2. For frontend client app made with Blazor WebAssembly
   3. For DTOs models(although it was said to make 2-projects solution, I considered it would be appropriate to made one more project to make DTO classes     to follow conventions, hope it won't be a problem)
-- Tried to encapsulate functionality as much as possible by adding services and extension methods, although it still can be improved by adding services to wrap DBcontext class related functionality.
